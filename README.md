## Conclusions and Recommendations:
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of bank customer details, including demographics, loan activity, and transaction patterns, derived from 2,798 customer records. Key
metrics indicate N679M in total savings, N934.345M in loans issued, and N76.59M in total transactions. A critical finding reveals that a significant 89.79% of customers are not currently
utilizing loan facilities, while transaction volumes experienced a notable decline from Q1 to Q4. Loan analytics highlight "Seniors" as the age group with the highest loan uptake, and Lagos as the city with the largest loan amounts, indicating concentrated lending activity. Males show a slightly higher loan uptake compared to females. This presents a substantial opportunity for the bank to develop targeted loan products and campaigns, particularly focusing on the senior demographic and key markets like Lagos, to convert the large proportion of non-loan customers into active borrowers.

To optimize performance, it is recommended to investigate the root causes of the declining quarterly transaction volumes and implement strategies to reverse this trend. The bank should
continue to enhance popular transaction channels such as mobile and ATM services to improve customer experience and retention. Furthermore, leveraging the high balances in savings
accounts through cross-selling and developing segmented financial products based on customer demographics and occupations could unlock significant growth potential.
